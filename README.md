# GrabCutSegmentation
**Interactive image segmentation using GraphCut**<br />
GrabCut is an improved image segmentation algorithm , which is based on graph cut theory.<br />
It only needs a small amount of user interaction to get better segmentation results.<br /><br />
This demo uses the OpenCV library calling its grabcut algorithm interface to achieve grabcut image segmentation.<br />
After drawing the frame, if you press the key 1, then split up.If you press the key 2 ,it can be saved, <br />
and the mouse press can reselect the rectangle to re-segment.<br />
